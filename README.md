# Halloween-mask-using-face-recognition
This project involves blending masks of different types on human faces from a video feed (on your own face) and manipulating the background to suit a certain occasion (here Halloween).
The file - face_recog.py is the code of the project.
You have to save images in your opencv directory containing numpy, else you will get an error. Error also appears if your face is not recognised properly, for that you have to steady your face or you can create your own training data set of your face for which you can refer the link -

Feel free to write your valuable feedback.
Thanx!
